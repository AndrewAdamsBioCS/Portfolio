	<p>An interactive iOS mobile application designed to help users follow the practice of mindful eating, Food for Thought was collaboratively developed by a four-person team as part of a semester-long software engineering project. The project evolved in response to the needs of a real-life dietitian acting as our client, and spanned the full life cycle of development, from conceptualization to final product delivery.
