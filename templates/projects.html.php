	<p>Try your hand at the classic "Lights Out" puzzle, then see the performance of several search algorithms in solving it!</p>
	<p>All puzzles are randomly generated. Each algorithm displays its move-by-move solution, as well as data on its performance, including search steps taken and time for completion. Some puzzles can be solved in under a tenth of a second!</p>
